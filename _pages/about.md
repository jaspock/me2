Dr. Juan Antonio Pérez-Ortiz is an associate professor in computer science and researcher at Universitat d’Alacant, Spain, director of the Transducens research group, and co-founder of Prompsit Language Engineering. 

He has worked on machine translation (rule-based, statistical and neural) and computer-aided translation since 1999, especially as a member of the team involved in the development of the rule-based machine translation system Apertium. He has also researched in the field of interactive translation prediction and hybridisation of different machine translation paradigms. 

He received his Ph.D. in computer science in 2002 with a thesis on recurrent neural models for sequence processing that used, among others, distributional representations for natural language processing tasks and LSTM cells. His current research focuses on neural language technologies for low-resource languages.
